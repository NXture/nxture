    <title>Important tools for Web Development</title>
    <meta name="description" content="NXture is a personal website created to keep a track on my Learning and Development Pathway. Along with latest Blogs and Articles on my field notes about technology, education, and other Resources. I'm a student and freelancer living in Bangalore City, India. Currently, I have a degree of Bachelor in Computer Application(BCA - Specialization in Data Science) at Jain University. I've got a serious passion for Game Development, Animation, Web - Development, Machine learning, and Data Analytics. Why I decided to Create and Host my Own Website ? As I mentioned before, I'm still a student. So I still have a lot to learn, process, and understand before I call myself a full-stack, front-end Developer. This is where my website comes to action, through this site I plan to keep a track on my learning pathway.As I learn new things, I plan to post and update this site regularly, about what I learned and how I did it. Are you interested in creating your own websites like mine or better than mine? Feel free to contact me, let's make something great together.">

                <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 mx-auto">
                    <p>Before we get into Web Development, we need to set up with all the necessary tools you're going to need to get up and going. While I'm not a Mac or Linux dev ( or least haven't been for a long time) I'll try to make sure we get you
                        in with some good tools. What's important here is that you find what works for you. Every developer has very strong opinions about their tools and will tell you that is some reason you have to use their tools. Don't listen to them.
                        Find what works for you. If you find yourself fighting your tools more than they're helping you, consider trying something else. Keep an open mind. What's shiny or popular is not necessarily going to work for you. Take time to
                        invest in making your tools work the best for you. Small wins amount to huge boots in productivity in the long term.</p>
                    <h2>The Browser</h2>
                    <p>One of your biggest allies in writing websites is the web browser. You may not be yet aware but your browser has a myriad of developer tools built into it that help you understand your code, helps you find bugs, and helps you experiment
                        directly on your running website. All of the modern browsers are great and you can use any one of them to develop sites with. I recommend you pick one and really get to know its developer's tools.</p>
                    <h3>My Recommendation: Chrome</h3><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwxqX4BRBhEiwAYtJX7aLOKViq2qzJmiRWw1NZiVRsgNK3hjFLcXzX1tHuAQut_FTHmpyXShoC2_QQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Click Here to Download Google Chrome</span></em></a>
                    <p>That being said, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or FireFox are all very, very good browsers with great dev tools too. If you feel comfortable with one of these already, stick with it. If you're using Safari, make sure you enable dev tools.</p>
                    <h2>The Editor</h2>
                    <p>One of the most controversial things you can ask a developer is which editor is the best. There are so many strongly-held opinions that it's hard to tell which one is going to work for you. There are many flavors and it all depends
                        on what you want out of your editor: do you want it to hold your hand as much as possible? Do you want it to get out of the way? I'm going to give you several choices but let's start with what I've been using for a few years now.<br></p>
                    <h3>My Recommendation: Visual Studio Code</h3><a href="#"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Click Here to Download Visual Studio Code</span></em></a>
                    <p>It's a fantastic editor that has a lot of convenient features and helpers. To me it's the right balance of minimalism and helpers. It works in particular really well with front end development as well, and since the editor itself is
                        JavaScript-based, if you ever feel like adding a new feature or plugin to it, you'll already know the correct language to do so. It's free, open-source, and works well on Mac, Linux, and Windows. And perhaps one of the best features
                        of VSCode is it has a&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/vscode-marketplace"><em>huge amount of available plugins</em></a><br></p>
                    <p>If you're not feeling VSCode, two other editors that are similar in their offering are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"><em>Sublime Text 3</em></a>&nbsp;and<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://atom.io/"><em>Atom</em></a>. Both
                        are great. I used Sublime for a decade and I still like it. Both are free to download. Sublime has an unlimited trial that asks you to pay $80 when you can.<br></p>
                    <p>If you want a more complete offering, you may investigate using an integrated development environment (commonly called an IDE.) The reigning, best IDE for front end development is<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/"><em>WebStorm</em></a>.
                        WebStorm is a very powerful IDE that has a lot of features and tools built into it. It aims to be more than just an editor; it aims to be the entire development suite. Great tool.<br></p>
                    <p>Lastly, I'm going to simply state there are two more tools you could use:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vim.org/"><em>vim</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"><em>emacs</em></a>. These are tool that you
                        use in the command line / terminal and use&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;the keyboard, no mouse. These tools have a very difficult learning curve but once you're productive in them they allow you to go very fast. My advice for you is:
                        don't, especially right now as you're learning to code. If you want to revisit it later then you could do that. But just know that it is indeed quite difficult.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 32px;">The Terminal</h2>
                    <p>There are two things to worry about when talking about the terminal, and I'll try to help you tell the difference between the two: the&nbsp;<strong>shell</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>terminal emulator</strong>. The terminal emulator
                        is the actual window in your operating system; it itself doesn't execute or understand your commands you're sending to it. The shell is the code running inside of the terminal emulator. This shell can be swapped out to whatever
                        shell you want to run. Unlike the things I recommended above, these various terminal emulators and shells vary a lot more by operating system.<br></p>
                    <p>For the terminal emulator, it doesn't matter a whole lot which one you use. I personally use cmd for Windows,&nbsp;you can just as easily use the default Mac Terminal.app or&nbsp;<a href="https://hyper.is/"><em>Hyper</em></a>&nbsp;for
                        Mac. If you're on Linux, I'd say just use whatever the OS's default emulator is. You can use any one of these in your Web Development Journey.<br></p>
                    <p>For the shell, we are going to use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"><em>bash</em></a>. You don't need to install it unless you're using Windows (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10"><em>then use these steps to enable it</em></a>).
                        It's 99% already there on your computer unless you're using some obscure flavor of Linux. Whenever you open your Mac terminal, it'll be running bash by default unless you've changed it.<br></p>
