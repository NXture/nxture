    <meta name="description" content="NXture is a personal website created to keep a track on my Learning and Development Pathway. Along with latest Blogs and Articles on my field notes about technology, education, and other Resources. I'm a student and freelancer living in Bangalore City, India. Currently, I have a degree of Bachelor in Computer Application(BCA - Specialization in Data Science) at Jain University. I've got a serious passion for Game Development, Animation, Web - Development, Machine learning, and Data Analytics. Why I decided to Create and Host my Own Website ? As I mentioned before, I'm still a student. So I still have a lot to learn, process, and understand before I call myself a full-stack, front-end Developer. This is where my website comes to action, through this site I plan to keep a track on my learning pathway.As I learn new things, I plan to post and update this site regularly, about what I learned and how I did it. Are you interested in creating your own websites like mine or better than mine? Feel free to contact me, let's make something great together.">

                        <p>JavaScript is a language with interesting beginnings. In it's early days, it was not taken very seriously - the only widely accepted. functionally correct use for the language was to perform client-side validation of form data.
                            Many developers only copied and pasted simple code snippets that performed a single action on a website they were building. All these code snippets did were very simple actions such as reveal an alert to the user or provide
                            a date countdown - simple logic.</p>
                        <p>Today, JavaScript is awhole different beast - and one with the power to literally build out entire HTML documents, revise CSS styling on the fly, and securely transfort and interpret data from various remote sources. Whereas in
                            time past, HTML was the primary technology on the web, in the present era, JavaScript is King.</p>
                        <p>Any introduction to JavaScript requires a foundational background of the history and origins of language in order to move forward and achieve comptency. This article introduces you to JavaScript, from its history to modern implementations.
                            It also provides us with additional information on various uses of the language so that I can provide a proper context for what comes next.</p>
                        <h3>What is JavaScript and How Is it Used?</h3>
                        <p>JavaScript is lossely-typed, multi-paradigm, event-driven, object-orented programming language. It includes the ability to work with strings, dates, arrays, objects, and more. It is generally used on the clint-side within web browser
                            environments but can also be used in other environments such as servers and desktop applications. The runtime environment is very important for JavaScript - especially since it, by itself, does not include any networking, file,
                            graphics, or storage capabilities on its own.&nbsp;</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>JavaScript versus Other Languages</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">If you are approaching JavaScript with experience in other languages such as Java or Python, things might seem a bit odd. While many languages (such as Java) must be compiled to run, JavaScript is run exactly as-is and does not require
                        this additional step.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Though the language is used within many environments and for many purpose, JavaScript is fundamentally one of the three languages that are native to the web. The other two languages are the HTML semantic markup language and CSS styling
                        and layout language. All three are very different form one another in purpose adn function, but they are all meant to worl together in a single environment. Let's go over them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><em>Hypertext&nbsp;Markup Language (HTML):</em></strong> This is the most fundamental of these languages as it defines the elements that compose an HTML page and defines the flow of basic information that's presented to
                            the user.</li>
                        <li><strong><em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):</em></strong> This is used to define a set of stylistic layout rules, which adds visual flourish and advanced layout to defined HTML elements.</li>
                        <li><strong><em>JavaScript (JS): </em></strong>This works to enable interactivity in web pages and is what will be the focus of this article.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">With all three of these languages, there is a basic understanding of the separation of concerns, that is, HTML provides the content and structure, CSS provides the styling and layout, and JavaScript provides the interactivity. While
                        this understanding still holds sway, many frameworks do not exactly abide by thid separation and mix these various languages together in some shape or form. Some developers are okay with this, while others are not. It's definately
                        an issue to be aware of when getting into this field, but it is ultimately up to you which stance you take, based on your particular needs. There is no hard and fast answers to a queston like this.</p>
