    <title>History of JavaScript</title>
    <meta name="description" content="NXture is a personal website created to keep a track on my Learning and Development Pathway. Along with latest Blogs and Articles on my field notes about technology, education, and other Resources. I'm a student and freelancer living in Bangalore City, India. Currently, I have a degree of Bachelor in Computer Application(BCA - Specialization in Data Science) at Jain University. I've got a serious passion for Game Development, Animation, Web - Development, Machine learning, and Data Analytics. Why I decided to Create and Host my Own Website ? As I mentioned before, I'm still a student. So I still have a lot to learn, process, and understand before I call myself a full-stack, front-end Developer. This is where my website comes to action, through this site I plan to keep a track on my learning pathway.As I learn new things, I plan to post and update this site regularly, about what I learned and how I did it. Are you interested in creating your own websites like mine or better than mine? Feel free to contact me, let's make something great together.">

                        <p>We've seen how JavaScript is often integrated within a web environment, but how did this language come about? We need to go back to the early 1990s and understand what the web looked like in those days before we begin talking about
                            JavaScript itself.<br></p>
                        <p>The story really begins with Netscape and the web browser they created named&nbsp;<strong>Netscape Navigator</strong>. This new browser was based on the successful Mosaic web browser with the intent to commercialise it. During
                            that time, and depending on who you speak to, Netscape Navigator was the web browser of choice to develop for. Around the middle of the decade, Microsoft released its&nbsp;<strong>Internet Explorer</strong>&nbsp;browser, which
                            ignited the first browser wars.<br></p>
                        <h2><strong>Netscape Mocha and LiveScript</strong><br></h2>
                        <p>Around this same time, Netscape hired Brendan Eich to develop a programming language for Netscape's web browser. Eich took inspiration from Scheme (Lisp), Self, and most importantly, Java. The work on this language, then called&nbsp;<strong>Mocha</strong>,
                            was initially (and infamously) completed in the time span of only 10 days. With the initial version completed, Netscape changed their name and began calling it&nbsp;<strong>LiveScript.</strong><br></p>
                        <p>It turned out that LiveScript, as a language name, was just as temporary as Mocha until Netscape partnered with a certain other large company to advance the idea of a two-pronged approach to web development.<br></p>
                        <h2><strong>Sun Microsystems and Java</strong><br></h2>
                        <p>The popular Java language came into play with a partnership between Netscape and Sun Microsystems. Sun was looking at the web as the next step for Java, and Netscape was looking for allies in the coming war against Microsoft, so
                            an allegiance was formed. The language being developed by Eich was from then on named&nbsp;<strong>JavaScript</strong>&nbsp;as it was meant to work alongside Java in the web browser as a more approachable way to add interactivity
                            to that environment.<br></p>
                        <p>This would mean that the Java language would be what&nbsp;<em>serious</em>&nbsp;developers used to write interactive content for the web, while JavaScript would provide similar interactive capabilities but was geared more toward&nbsp;<em>hobbyists</em>&nbsp;and
                            those who wanted to tinker.<br></p>
                        <p class="bg-light border rounded shadow-sm"><br>What happened, of course, was quite different. JavaScript was integrated into the browser well before Java was, and, once Java came on board, it was only through the use of applets. With Java applets falling out of popularity
                            quite some time ago, we are left with JavaScript alone today and not the two languages that were initially envisioned, though the&nbsp;<em>JavaScript</em>&nbsp;name has stuck!<br><br></p>

                    <!-- End: Text -->
                    <h2><strong>Ecma International and ECMAScript</strong><br></h2>
                    <p>This would mean that the Java language would be what&nbsp;<em>serious</em>&nbsp;developers used to write interactive content for the web, while JavaScript would provide similar interactive capabilities but was geared more toward&nbsp;<em>hobbyists</em>&nbsp;and
                        those who wanted to tinker.<br></p>
                    <p>So far, we read about how JavaScript came to be and performed a quick activity that showed how it can be examined live within the web browser itself. At this point, you should have a pretty good idea of exactly what JavaScript is,
                        where it came from, and how it operates.<br></p>
                    <p>In the next step, we'll look at some more history behind this language by examining the version history of JavaScript beyond ECMA standardization.<br></p>
